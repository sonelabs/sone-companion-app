# SONE Companion App: Real-Time Notifications for Caregivers

The SONE Companion App is a React Native mobile app designed for nursing staff and caregivers. It pairs with the SONE Tablet App, receiving notifications when a patient requests assistance.

The app streamlines patient–caregiver communication, making sure patient needs such as “I need water” or “I’m in pain” are instantly routed and relayed to the appropriate staff.

## How It Works

1. **Patient Initiates Request**: Using the tablet app, patients select predefined options.

2. **Caregiver Notification**: The Companion App receives the request as a push notification.

3. **Action**: Staff can view, prioritize, and acknowledge the request directly within the app.
